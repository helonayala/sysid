# Welcome

Welcome! This repository hosts the class notes for an introduction to the fundamental concepts of **system identification**.

To foster a **hands-on learning experience**, these notes include adaptable Python scripts. You're encouraged to build upon this **starter code**. 

Originally developed in MATLAB, the scripts have been translated to Python (with assistance from LLMs) and are now readily accessible online within these notes. 

Students can easily navigate the material and click the [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](YOUR_COLAB_NOTEBOOK_LINK_HERE) to start experimenting directly in their browser.

I hope you find this resource valuable. The methods are demonstrated using **real-world data**, allowing you to explore both the **potentialities and limitations** of the techniques discussed.
