# Linear Systems

In this section, we explore two different types of estimation:

* **Batch Least Squares (BLS)**, which is obtained by minimizing the prediction error of a defined linear discrete-time model.
* **Recursive Least Squares (RLS)**, which extends the BLS formulation to operate iteratively. This approach leads to the same equations found in the Kalman filter.

Activities are proposed at the end of this section.
